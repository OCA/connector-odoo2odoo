================
Odoo2Odoo - Node
================

This module is required on all *Odoo* instances synchronized by an *Odoo*
backend (see the ``odoo2odoo_backend`` module).

It simply adds new CRUD methods similar to ``create``, ``read``, ``write``
and ``unlink`` to focus on the data and avoid undesirable behavior (custom
overloads of the standard methods). These new methods are then used by the
``odoo2odoo_backend`` module to drive the synchronization.

Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/{project_repo}/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
